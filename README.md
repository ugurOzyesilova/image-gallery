Introduction:
-------------
This project is a monochrome gallery app built using ReactJS and Pexels API. The app allows users to search for images, save them, download them, and also implements pagination. The saved images are stored in the local storage of the user's device.

Features:
----------
Search Functionality: Users can search for monochrome images using keywords.
Pagination: The app implements pagination to display a limited number of images per page, improving the user experience and performance.
Save Functionality: Users can save their favorite images to their local storage for future use.
Download Functionality: Users can download the images they like directly from the app.
Implementation:
The app is built using ReactJS and Pexels API. The app has a search bar where users can input their desired keywords, and upon clicking the search button, the app makes an API call to Pexels API to retrieve the images. The retrieved images are then displayed using pagination, which allows users to browse through them easily.

When the user clicks on an image, they are given the option to save it. If they choose to save the image, the app stores the image data in the local storage of their device. This allows them to access their favorite images even when they are offline.

Lastly, users can download the images they like by clicking the download button, which prompts them to save the image to their device.

Conclusion:
-----------
This project is a monochrome gallery app built using ReactJS and Pexels API. It allows users to search for images, save them, download them, and implements pagination for improved performance. The saved images are stored in the local storage of the user's device, allowing them to access their favorite images even when they are offline.
